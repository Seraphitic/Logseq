- LATER Work on custom css theme for logseq
  later:: 1625579947098
- LATER Figure out what I want to do with the Habitica python script #programming
  later:: 1625579971343
	- Ideas:
		- Auto-accept quests
		- Auto-cast spells
		- Pull tasks from somewhere else and push it into Habitica with all data
			- Preferably able to read logseq file data and put it in Habitica
			- Could possibly make a tag for the script to look for to know to take that line.
		- Have Habitica function like a GTD
- Possibly might want to change browser to Vivialdi
	- Pros:
		- Vivaldi is very featureful and customizable
		- Vivaldi has the file API so that I can use Logseq in browser to edit local files.
		- Integrated mail, messenger, calendar experience
		- Note taking integrated
	- Cons:
		- Already integrated into Brave pretty well
		- Need to move bookmarks
		- Have to set up and customize Vivaldi which will take time
		- **No BAT gain**
		- Vivaldi not privacy focused; might not be the best security-wise.
		- Have to also figure out what to do about the android browser
		- Don't know how fast one is compared to the other.
			- LATER Might want to see if there's some kind of speed test that I could run

- Seems like it might be better to keep my Habitica script in Python rather than trying to make the API calls in JavaScript.
- Code for the python script for now:
	-
	  ```python
	  import requests
	  
	  r = requests.get('https://habitica.com/api/v3/tasks/user', headers = {'x-api-user': '62d9c244-e14c-48d2-b572-00f319078c2a', 'x-api-key': 'b18d16c9-1f5e-42f5-aa5b-fcfa47fc86c1'})
	  
	  print(r.json())
	  ```
- Really need to make some time to read through [[Getting Things Done]].

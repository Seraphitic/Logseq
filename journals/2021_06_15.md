- How would the GTD system be structured?
	- Keep acts as the Inbox
	- Maybe/Someday would be a separate tag
	- Reference would be a separate tag
	- Projects get tagged and individual steps are planned out and given either NOW label or LATER label
	- Delegated things can be tagged and given a scheduled time to check in on
	- Events can be scheduled on Logseq and in Google Calendar.
		- Google Calendar is probably to be preferred since it will provide a reminder
		- Logseq will be able to lay things out for me when looking at the journal entry for the day.
	- 'NOW' acts as Next Actions
		- Need to check that Context tags can work

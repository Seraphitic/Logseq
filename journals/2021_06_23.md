- Snakes at Reflection Riding
	- Held all snakes
	- King snake is definitely in bad shape
	- Sarah wanted to know about ideas for further snake enrichment
		- Possibly having some kind of outdoor area for the snakes to climb/swim in might be a good idea.
		- Possibly some kind of maze for the turtles.
		- Would probably be a lot of extra volunteer hourse
	- Possibly should have some kind of script for talking about the snakes
- Chess club
	- Had some success against the Sicilian last night
	- Need to learn the Bf4 main line of the Caro-Kann if possible

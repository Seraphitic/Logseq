** 1.1 Periodic Functions, Fourier Series on $(-\pi,\pi)$
*** *Definition*: A function is /periodic/ with period $p$ if $f(x) = f(x+p), \forall x$
*** *Theorem*: If function $f$ has a period $p$, then integer multiples of $p$ are also periods of $f$
*** *Corollary*: The graph of $f$ shifted by $kp$ equals the original graph
*** *Definition*: The /trigonometric system/, $p = \pi$, is the set of functions $$1, \sin x, \cos x, \sin 2x, \cos 2x, ...$$

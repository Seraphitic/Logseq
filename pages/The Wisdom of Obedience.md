- Notes:
	- Who's wisdom do we listen to?
	- Fire/car alarm not believed
		- What's going on in this passage is that people aren't understanding the alarms going off.
		- We just don't care about the alarms going off in God's word.
		- Wisdom - the skill of godly living
		- Obedience
			- Nobody likes the word; we don't want to be told what to do
	- Danger of disobedience: forgetting and growing cold (v.1-4)
		- The people of God have a history of forgetting
		- We rehearse the things we shouldn't; our mistakes and shame
		- We don't rehearse what we should; God's faithfulness and love
		- Joshua and the crossing of the Jordan
			- Stones placed to remember meaning and God's faithfulness
	- Danger of disobedience: self-sufficient and self-selective (v.5-8)
		- Those who are mature are more reliant on God, not less
		- The feeling of faith is not strength, but weakness
		- More of God and less of me
		- Can't select areas where we trust or don't trust God
			- Selective dependence leads to selective obedience
	- Danger of disobedience: becoming selfish (v.9-10)
		- Everything is given to us anyway
	- Danger of disobedience: struggle with reproof (v.11-12)
		- That is exactly what God's people are supposed to feel.
		- We don't want to do the things that God wants us to do
	- The Results of Obedience
		- A full and promised life; not prosperity, but the life we were created to have.
		- The gift of obedience is growing in the skill of godly living.
		- We think obedience is boring
			- Have to reframe the way we think about obedience.
			- Follow God not because we have to but because we get to.
			- Know that no matter what, God is enough for me.
		- All of Wisdom's ways are peace; life working how it should (though not always the way we would like it)
		- Wisdom is a tree of life
			- Believe what God says, unlike Adam and Eve
		- Jesus' life for ours

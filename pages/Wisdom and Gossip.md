			- We have an intimate place in our soul with a hole in it that is currently empty
			- We turn to gossip to fill it
	- We have a need to fill our soul-hole and so we turn to sin.
- What can we do?
	- Hold our tongue
		- Trying to get 'justice' when someone wrongs you, so we gossip

			-
			  >A friend is someone who will stab you from the front

	- God is just as bothered by our hate and desire to spread gossip as the thing that hurt us.
